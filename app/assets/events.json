Won't this cause conflict and misunderstanding across the teams and leadership? As an organization begins the process of applying Agile they often realize that one single framework may not fit every scenario within the organization. Participants in this session will begin by experiencing this difference (in a simulation you can take home). As a group, we will identify when there is a need to make a change, discuss why it’s OK to make the change and review real-world scenarios that you may be experiencing right now which cry out for more than one way of “skinning the cat”!",

In this talk, we will look at ways to help a developer, at any level, grow in an organic way. By opening the avenue of finding a mentor/mentee, looking at some awesome open source projects and playing an active role on mailing lists and group discussions, developers can find ways to grow that are challenging yet very rewarding",

But how in the world do you get an open source project off the ground? Where do you even start? Write code and push it to Github? Is that it? Short answer: No. While pushing code to Github may be all that’s technically needed, there are some social conventions, tools, formats and other issues you’ll need to conquer if you want your open source project to really soar. I know, because I went through that pain recently. Join me as I recount the steps, mistakes, re-do’s and learning necessary to get PoshStack (an open source PowerShell module) started as a viable open source project. If you have an idea for an open source project, but don’t know how or where to start, you don’t want to miss this session.",
