The 56-year-old El-Erian, who made $100 million in 2011 alone, said he made the decision to resign from his post after his young daughter wrote him a note listing 22 milestones he had missed in her life.</p> <p>You might tell yourself that once you make the kind of money Mr. El-Erian does you will slow down too. But itís not likely that you would choose to slow down even after making his millions. Some people donít know how to really enjoy life, or are so fueled by the power and prestige, that everything else is easily pushed aside in the process.</p> <p>Iím sure youíve heard the expression that we have two lives; the one we are given and the other one we make. Only YOU can say what type of life you want to have.</p> <p>In this session Mr. Hunt will tackle the topic of having a real Work/Life Balance and will share some key aspects that will hopefully help you win this struggle to balance both your personal and professional goals.<br /><br /></p>",
